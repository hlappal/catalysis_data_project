# Catalysis data project

These are script files related to my master's thesis project. The scripts query
[Catalysis-hub](http://catalysis-hub.org) and
[CatApp](https://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/catapp/catapp.html#catapp1) databases for
heterogeneous catalysis reaction data.

**catalysis\_hub.ipynb** searches the Catalysis-hub database.

**catapp.ipynb** searches the CatApp database.

**preprocess.ipynb** performs preprocessing on the data, unifying the datasets
into one, and cleaning the data.

**model.ipynb** runs the machine learning models training and predictions on the data.

**case\_study.ipynb** runs the predictions of activation energy on case study reactions.
